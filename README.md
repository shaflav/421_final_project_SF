# 421_final_project_SF
## Usage
This code should be run on an Adafruit Circuit Playground. Any edition of hardware should work, however, I prototyped with the developer edition. The sketch requires you to have the Circuit Playground library installed in Arduino and relies on the light sensor to inititate it. 
## Hardware

Just connect the Circuit Playground the a computer with a USB cable, open the file in the Arduino software and upload.
